# **Pump Failure Prediction Using Sensor Data**

## **Overview**
This project aims to demonstrate how sensor data can provide actionable insights for predictive maintenance in water pump systems. Predictive maintenance is a crucial aspect of operational efficiency, ensuring that devices work reliably and reducing the risk of costly downtimes. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project seeks to predict pump failures in advance, providing value to executive-level managers and showcasing the potential of sensor data analytics.

## **Business Objective**
Water pump systems are critical components of a companyâ€™s infrastructure, especially in industries that rely heavily on consistent water supply. The primary goals of this project are:
1. **Failure Prediction**: Detect pump failures in advance to prevent disruptions.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Improve reliability by identifying key failure patterns and trends in sensor data.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains time-series sensor readings for a water pump system, including both operational and failure data. The key features include:
- Time-series timestamps for capturing trends.
- Labels indicating normal operations and pump failures.

The dataset will serve as the basis for:
1. Understanding trends and patterns.
2. Building and validating machine learning models.

## **Approach**
This project will be tackled using an end-to-end data science workflow, as outlined below:

### **1. Data Understanding**
- **Goal**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, quality, and key trends in the data.
- **Actions**:
  - Analyze missing values, data distributions, and correlations.
  - Visualize key sensor trends over time to identify failure patterns.

---

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- **Goal**: Prepare the data for machine learning.
- **Actions**:
  - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
  - Feature engineering to create new, meaningful attributes (e.g., rolling averages, deltas).
  - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical ones.
  - Split the data into training, and testing sets.

---

### **3. Model Development**
- **Goal**: Develop machine learning models to predict pump failures.
- **Actions**:
  - Train multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
  - Use performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate models.
  - Optimize hyperparameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization.

---

### **4. Model Deployment**
- **Goal**: Deploy the predictive model to showcase real-time operational feasibility.
- **Actions**:
  - Develop a Pipeline for cloud deployment in Azure Machine Learning.
  - Containerize the application using Docker for portability.
  - Develop a REST API using Flask/FastAPI for serving the model.

### **5. Visualization and Reporting**
- **Goal**: Present insights and predictions to stakeholders effectively.
- **Actions**:
  - Create a Tableau dashboard to visualize sensor trends and prediction outputs.
  - Develop reports highlighting business impact and recommendations.
