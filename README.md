# **Pump Failure Prediction Using Sensor Data**

## **Overview**
This project aims to demonstrate how sensor data can provide actionable insights for predictive maintenance in water pump systems. Predictive maintenance is a crucial aspect of operational efficiency, ensuring that devices work reliably and reducing the risk of costly downtimes. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project seeks to predict pump failures in advance, providing value to executive-level managers and showcasing the potential of sensor data analytics.

## **Business Objective**
Water pump systems are critical components of a companyâ€™s infrastructure, especially in industries that rely heavily on consistent water supply. The primary goals of this project are:
1. **Failure Prediction**: Detect pump failures in advance to prevent disruptions.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Improve reliability by identifying key failure patterns and trends in sensor data.
3. **Value Demonstration**: Convince stakeholders of the benefits of working with sensor data for predictive analytics.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains time-series sensor readings for a water pump system, including both operational and failure data. The key features include:
- Sensor readings such as temperature, pressure, vibration levels, and flow rates.
- Time-series timestamps for capturing trends.
- Labels indicating normal operations and pump failures.

The dataset will serve as the basis for:
1. Understanding trends and patterns.
2. Building and validating machine learning models.
3. Demonstrating predictive maintenance capabilities.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- **Goal**: Prepare the data for machine learning.
- **Actions**:
  - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
  - Feature engineering to create new, meaningful attributes (e.g., rolling averages, deltas).
  - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical ones.
  - Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

---

### **3. Model Development**
- **Goal**: Develop machine learning models to predict pump failures.
- **Actions**:
  - Train multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
  - Use performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate models.
  - Optimize hyperparameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization.
